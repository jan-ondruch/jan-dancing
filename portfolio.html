			<article>First time I tried contemporary dance was in Wannsee (Berlin) in 2012. I participated in a one week long workshop and I took it more as a fun challenge. It was a completely new experience for me. I tried to be really open minded back then and tried my best to embrace new ideas and mindsets, even though my overly rational part was doing it's best not to change anything.
			<br></br>
			As the workshop was over, I was really happy. At that time, I pretty much stayed the same way I was (100% 	logically-thinking stubborn kid). However, I got a glimpse into a different "reality", where emotions, empathy and mental freedom could be a part of me.
			<br></br>
			During the next 3 years, I didn't dance contemporary apart from those annual workshops in Berlin. However, I started with some ballroom dancing, as well as with street dancing later. I loved doing all of them.
			<br></br>
			Finally in September 2015 I took up a contemporary dance course at Dashdance. I already knew some concepts from the workshops and got quickly addicted to the weekly course. Dash is an amazing teacher and I learned a lot during the next 10 months. 
			<br></br>
			At this moment, I still dance contemporary and even have a chance from time to time teach someone a few moves and techniques - especially contact improvisation. Since I love teaching, it's something I totally enjoy doing.
			<br></br>
			Funnily enough, as I have been doing everything from ballroom dancing, street to zumba, as well, my own contemporary dancing style has been developing and has become a mixture of all the above mentioned.
			<br></br>
			I am not planning to stop dancing contemporary. It nicely balances the rational part of me and helps me to loosen up my mind, but also to understand people more.

			<article>Ballroom dance is one of the first dances I did. I took those usual courses for schools both in elementary school and high school. Because I have always loved sports and practically "any" kind of movement, ballroom dancing caught my attention.
			<br></br>
			So after the high school course in 2011, I decided to keep going with my dancing partner and we started to attend a ballroom dancing course for advanced. We took part in 2 competitions, one regional and the second was a national (Czech Republic), where we got our asses kicked.
			<br></br>
			In the upcoming years I danced only on high-school balls. That was about it. I still enjoyed it, but didn't take anycourse.
			<br></br>
			Until recently, as I moved to Germany to study there for one year.  I have been attending ballroom dancing course twice a week. I have learned new styles and it's been awesome!
			<br></br>
			What is great is that those courses are kinda free: "Do you like to dance, chill, whatever ...? If yes, visit us!". So if you want to dance, you dance, if you want to learn something, there are always people around who will help you. Do you want to teach someone something new? Anything! 
			<br></br>
			So every time I come, I learn maybe a new dancing figure or two, I teach someone something and have a lot of fun with other people!
